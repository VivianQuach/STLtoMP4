# Creating MP4 from STL file's Using Open3d 

Wanted to create a CAD note on my website with a 360 degree rotation of my models. <br>
I've created a mp4 video file from stl files using trimesh and pyrender since I was using python 3.6. <br> 
But what fun would that be if I just used that. So I thought it would be fun to try using open3d. <br>

### Running Errors 
If your code doesn't work for with the lastest open3d version or cv2. Look at the Requirement.txt file.
